Adonis UI is an open source UI library for WPF applications. It offers styles and templates for all major WPF controls. The visual design aims at being similar to WPF's built-in style, but brings a visual overhaul to create a more consistent modern look.

<h2>Design principles</h2>
</center>

<h3><blockquote>1. Stay close to WPF's original look and feel.</blockquote></h3>

<h3><blockquote>2. Do not require any configuration but provide options for those who want to control global and individual behavior.</blockquote></h3>

<h3><blockquote>3. Favor extension of WPF's built-in controls over creation of new ones in order to be a drop-in replacement for existing applications.</blockquote></h3>
